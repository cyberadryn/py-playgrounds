# Python Multithreading Course

This repository is a structured learning resource for Python multithreading.

## Goals

- Understand what threads are and when to use them.
- Learn Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and its implications.
- Practice using `threading`, synchronization primitives, and `concurrent.futures`.
- Explore common pitfalls such as race conditions and deadlocks.
- Learn patterns and best practices for safe multithreaded code.

## Layout

- `docs/` — Conceptual explanations and lecture-style notes.
- `examples/` — Small runnable scripts demonstrating each topic.
- `exercises/` — Assignments for you to implement.
- `solutions/` — Sample solutions (avoid peeking too early!).
- `tests/` — Basic unit tests for some examples.
- `advanced/` — More realistic and tricky patterns and pitfalls.

## Getting Started

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
2. Run examples directly:

   ```bash
   python examples/01_basic_thread/basic_thread.py

```
